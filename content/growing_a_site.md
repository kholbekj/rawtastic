# Growing a site

What's to stop me from going and making a cool [Neocities](https://neocities.org) site right now?

You go there, pick a name (2 hours gone, this feels way too permanent), and then you're presented with essentially a blank slate. Now, I know HTML fine, but the problem isn't the tech. What do I want this to look like? What should even go here? Is there a template I can copy? Help!

And then I search around for templates, end up finding sites, and my momentum is demolished in a cloud of pixelated flower petals.

With Eggstatic, I think I'll try a different approach. What if the site, brand new, was basically an egg - it's there, you can write your name on it with a sharpie, and then parade it to the world, jittering with anticipation of where it might go next?

```
   -\   o o o   /-
     --o-----o--
      o(  o  )o   /--
   --- o-----o  --
          |
          |   /--
    --\   |---
       ---|
          |       (that's a flower, btw)
```


We could make the start energy-inducing, and make the on-ramp so so smooth. No need for learning html. You can, later, if you want. You'll probably want to. But for now, just type text in a file, and it's going to be a presentable post on your website.

I think I like this idea a lot. We could start out with some scaffolding, really more of inspiration with some content there, and you could dismantle and rejigger it with increasing confidence.

The reality is, sites _are_ grown, but you there's this separation of initial creation and natural evolution. And while that all has it's own perks, websites are first and foremost about their content, and if we can get started authoring and doing things, then evolving into a wonderful representation of what you have to say should be natural.

Let's see. I'll take the energy the idea gives me and go add a getting started guide to the template.
