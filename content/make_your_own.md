# Make your own site!

The 'Egg' part of Eggstatic comes from the fact that each site can lay new little 'eggs' which can themselves hatch into fullblown sites. This is one of the key parts of this whole thing!

For you to have your very own website, all you need to do is follow along here, and you can be online with your completely own, independent website in minutes - you won't have to install software or learn any coding, all you will need is to write some content, and pick a place on the internet to put it.

Don't put it in your backlog, try it now. It's really cool!
