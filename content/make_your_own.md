# Make your own site!

The 'Egg' part of Eggstatic comes from the fact that each site can lay new little 'eggs' which can themselves hatch into fullblown sites. This is one of the key parts of this whole thing!

For you to have your very own website, all you need to do is follow along here, and you can be online with your completely own, independent website in minutes - you won't have to install software or learn any coding, all you will need is to write some content, and pick a place on the internet to put it. This will not cost you any money, or bind you to any service or provider. The website will be yours forever, to do with as you please. 

Don't put it in your backlog, do it now. It's something very special!

Websites used to be made roughly in this way:
1. Install some coding tools
2. Learn some code
3. Write some code
4. Write some content
5. Upload to a host on the internet

With eggstatic, we shuffle those steps, and skip a few, to bring your site onto the internet right away, and not overwhelm you with non-critical things to deal with.
So we're going to instead:
1. Write some content
2. Upload to a host on the internet
3. ??? - up to you

We can do this because eggstatic comes with enough code and writing tools out of the box, so you don't have to learn anything - but if you feel like, it also provides guidance on how to enhance your site with your own code later on.

## Your very own site

### Getting your egg
An Eggstatic 'egg' is a site that is unpublished. At first, it'll exist only in your browser, in the build-in editor. 

### Your first nest
Eggstatic provides everything you need customize your site and add content. We'll start by using this build-in nest to nuture our egg, and if and when you feel like trying a fancier editor on your own computer, we'll show you how.

### Incubation
...stretching the metaphor a bit, aren't I? Anyway, once you're ready to edit files, we'll author some content. I'd guess probably 1 minute from now.

### Hatching
Once we wrote something on the site, we're going to go through putting it live, on the internet! You'll have several options here, none of them will cost you anything, and we'll walk through it together.
