# Solarpunk
Lately, in no small amount because of my consumption of [smolweb](https://www.ilyameerovich.com/gemini-the-small-internet/), I've come across Solarpunk as a term, in a different way than I expected. I always thought it'd be like cyberpunk - a literary genre, an aesthetic, a type of sci-fi that shines a certain light on future thinking and stories.

Since my teens I was hooked cyberpunk, in particular as imagined in Neuromancer—a culture of hackers and artists fighting the dominating class of corporations. A thriving revolutionary underworld. etc. etc.

When I got a job for a bitcoin company in 2016, it was the cyberpunk romance that fueled me. Decentralized digital money, an attack on the corpo banks! It didn't take long in that industry to realize that it wasn't crypto against corp, it was corps finding new ways to avoid regulation and accumulate unchecked wealth at the expense of the naive. I kept trying to find use-cases for blockchain for a while, but after NFTs went apeshit and everything was clearly just layer upon layer of ponzinomics, I found the stance that this tech isn't going anywhere good. If for no other reason, then because of the actual people who are still in love with it.

I don't think cyberpunk really is much more than this - a super cool and fascinating sci-fi genre, meant as a warning more than a guide, that we can be inspired by or dream of, but which gives little in terms of guidance for the future. 

Solarpunk is something different.

It's a hopeful aesthetic of a sustainable future, embracing technology in a healthy way. It's so compelling and wholesome, and—as it turns—out also a movement that identifies with this vision, and the hopefulness it injects into our future outlook. 

I'm a pretty big fan of putting cool heroic imagery on things which are in fact worth idolizing, and I would hope that it's somewhat incontroversial to idolize living in harmony with our planet. Whether technology can be part of that image, or is anti-thetical to it, maybe less controversial.

Either way, I find myself inspired. As a technologist through and through, I can't imagine a post-technology utopia that I could see myself contributing to the realization of. Solarpunk, though? It's made me rethink some things, and inspired me to pick up my metaphorical pitchfork, not to form a mob in the streets looking for scapegoats, but to start building things that can put us one step closer to a sustainable technological future.
