Since my teens I was hooked cyberpunk, in particular as imagined in Neuromancer—a culture of hackers and artists fighting the dominating class of corporations. A thriving revolutionary underworld. etc. etc.

When I got a job for a bitcoin company in 2016, it was the cyberpunk romance that fueled me. Decentralized digital money, a way for people to transact without centralized authority! It didn't take long in that industry to realize that it wasn't crypto against the dystopian corporations, it was corps, aspiring corps and just a lot of greed, all finding new ways to avoid regulation and accumulate unchecked wealth at the expense of the naive. I kept trying to find use-cases for blockchain for a while, but after NFTs went apeshit and everything was clearly just layer upon layer of ponzinomics, I found the stance that this tech isn't going anywhere good.

Cyberpunk was always meant as a warning. Like much sci-fi, it explores a potential consequence of the path we're headed in as a species, and while the aesthetics are hypnotizing and alluring, it feeds on a negative outlook. The premise is that there's nothing anyone can do that's going to stop corporations or authoritarian governments from becoming the sole and dominant powers that govern everyone's lives.


Solarpunk takes a different approach.

It's a hopeful aesthetic of a sustainable future, embracing technology in a healthy way. It's so compelling and wholesome, and—as it turns—out also a movement that identifies with this vision, and the hopefulness it injects into our future outlook. This is something I ran across while perusing the [smolweb](https://www.ilyameerovich.com/gemini-the-small-internet/).

I'm a pretty big fan of putting cool heroic imagery on things which are in fact worth idolizing, and I would hope that it's somewhat incontroversial to idolize living in harmony with our planet. Whether technology can be part of that image, or is anti-thetical to it, maybe less controversial.

Solarpunk has it's problems though. It paints a target in capitalism as problem #1, as infinite grown on a finite planet cannot work. And valid as that may be, like Anarchism, it's extremely hard to paint a vivid and compelling picture of what such a society and life looks like, once you go beyond the very surface. How are we governed? How does it influence our technology and education? What happens when we ourgrow our environments? What about crime? Can the re-emmergence of capitalism be prevented?

No matter if you have answers for these questions, there can be no doubt that these are divisive questions, and Solarpunk, being a rather small literary body, does not have a lot of answers, to my knowledge.

What it does present, is the spirit of unification under the banner of sustainability. And I think sustainability dramatically needs idols and visions grounded not in discipline, shame, abstinence - but rather in the embrace of an awesome future that elevates sustainability to a core incredient, rather than a restriction on what would otherwise be desireable.

Either way, I find myself inspired. As a technologist through and through, I can't imagine a post-technology utopia that I could see myself contributing to the realization of. Solarpunk, though? It's inspired me to pick up my metaphorical pitchfork, not to form a mob in the streets looking for scapegoats, but to start building things that can put us one step closer to a sustainable technological future.
