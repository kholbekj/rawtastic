# Who is static sites for? (draft)

In my [last post](/content/static_websites.md), I decided to try to build a flow that could get a non-technical user on a windows machine to have a static site live on the web, using [Rawstatic](/content/about_this_site.md).

First step is probably to convince such a user that this is even a good idea!

So what's the point of having a website in the first place?
